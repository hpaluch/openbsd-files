# OpenBSD configuration files

My OpenBSD scripts and configuration files.

Please see also [My OpenBSD wiki page](https://github.com/hpaluch/hpaluch.github.io/wiki/OpenBSD)
and list of [My all wiki pages](https://github.com/hpaluch/hpaluch.github.io/wiki).

Typically I start installing few basic packages:
```shell
# favorite CLI packages
pkg_add btop curl fastfetch git lynx mc ncdu vim
# favorite GUI packages
pkg_add chromium firefox
```

I'm testing restrictive firewall that filters BOTH output and input
connections. See [firewall-out/](firewall-out/) for instructions.
